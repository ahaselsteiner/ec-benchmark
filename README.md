# A Benchmarking Exercise on Estimating Extreme Environmental Conditions for Engineering Design
## Datasets
The 8 datasets are loacted in the folder 'datasets'.
## Preparing your results
To prepare your results, please provide the coordinates of the environmental contour using the same format that the datasets have.
That means please separate all values with semicolons. The first two lines are for the header.
The first line contains the description of the environmental variables and the second line contains the symbols of the environmental variabels.
Please also plot your environmental contours using the plotting method provided in the file X.py.
