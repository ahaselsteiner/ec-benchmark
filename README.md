# A Benchmarking Exercise on Estimating Extreme Environmental Conditions: Methodology & Baseline Results
This is the official respository for the excercise annouced at OMAE 2019 ([paper](mailto:?subject=Send%20benchmarking%20exercise%20paper&body=Hi%20Andreas,%0D%0A%0D%0Acould%20you%20send%20me%20a%20copy%20of%20the%20paper%20that%20describes%20the%20benchmarking%20exercise?%0D%0A%0D%0ABest%20regards,), [presentation](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/blob/master/publications/2019-06-17_OMAE2019_BenchmarkingExercise.pdf)). The exercise is completed, but if you want to compare an environmental contour method that has not participated using the same analysis see [Compare your contour method with the benchmark](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark#compare-your-contour-method-with-the-benchmark).

## Updates
**August 11, 2020:** Yesterday, we held an online meeting on the benchmark's results. The presentation is available [here](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/tree/master/results/2020-08-10_EcBenchmarkMeeting_LowResolution.pdf) . 

**March 24, 2020:** The deadline for submitting results is extended to April 30, 2020.

## Datasets
The 6 datasets are located in the folder [datasets](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/tree/master/datasets).

The original datasets are owned by NDBC (datasets A, B & C) and WDCC (dataset D, E & F) and their terms of use apply:
* NDBC: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov
* WDCC: https://cera-www.dkrz.de/WDCC/ui/cerasearch/info?site=termsofuse

## Compare your contour method with the benchmark
For Exercise 1, we wrote the open-source analysis code such that also now that the exercise is completed, you can analyze additional contour methods using the same methods.

The [readme](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/tree/master/results/exercise-1) for Exercise 1, provides further instructions.
