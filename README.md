# A Benchmarking Exercise on Estimating Extreme Environmental Conditions for Engineering Design
## Datasets
The 6 datasets are loacted in the folder [datasets](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/tree/master/datasets).
## Preparing your results
To prepare your results, please provide the coordinates of the environmental contour using the same format that the datasets have.
That means please separate all values with semicolons. The first line represents the header.
In addition, please plot your environmental contours using the plotting method provided in the file [organizers-code/plot.py](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/blob/master/organizers-code/plot.py).
## Questions
We intend to use GitHub issues like a forum. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/issues/new) if you have a questions and we will answer it publicly in the same issue.
